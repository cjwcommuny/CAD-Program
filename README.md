# CAD-Program
A small program simulating CAD all coded by C.
The program is an assignment from Zhejiang University.

## Lib

The libraries of the program are all on my another repository "LibraryForC", some of them come from the text book, whose name is "The Art and Science of C Programming language", which Zhejiang University adopted. The main goal of libraries from the text book is to use the API in Windows, providing a easy access to it.

## Function

By this simple CAD program, we can draw, move, rotate, zoom in and out the object, including line, rectangle, ellipse. You can also generate the text and move it.
